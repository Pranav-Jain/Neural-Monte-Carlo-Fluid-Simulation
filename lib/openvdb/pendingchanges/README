This directory stores pending changes to our CHANGES and changes.txt
files.  The idea is that PRs can have their proposed changes audited
without triggering false merges.  We periodically collapse these into
the CHANGES and changes.txt.

Release versions should have this directory empty, but if you
checkout the latest version you may see changes reflected here that
haven't been merged into the CHANGES file yet.

This README must be maintained or git removes the directory and we
won't remember what directory to put changes into.
